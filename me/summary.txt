My name is Dylan Messerly, and I am a graduate of Texas State University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, graduating summa cum laude.

I'm currently a Software Developer at Eupraxia Labs, where I co-architected the Federal Frontier Platform—a GitOps-driven Kubernetes management system designed for secure, multi-account AWS and hybrid cloud environments. My day-to-day work involves building core Go backend services that power cluster creation, mutation, and teardown, along with multi-repo GitLab orchestration and atomic commit workflows. I've implemented OIDC provider automation, IRSA role provisioning, and dynamic Helm values templating to streamline DevOps operations across the platform.

One area I'm particularly excited about is the intersection of AI and infrastructure automation. I've built MCP servers and Python-based agents that enable AI-driven automation of Kubernetes operations and GitOps workflows, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with intelligent platform orchestration.
